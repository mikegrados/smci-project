# smci-project
This repository contains the code for data analysis and replication for our final project of the course Statistical Methods in Causal Inference (VU 2024).

- **1-data-processing:** Python codes that process raw data from [International IDEA](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout-database) website. It also contains code that computes basic descriptives of the resulting datasets and a comparison against the dataset from [Kostelka et al.](https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2022.57) paper.
- **2-causal-effect-estimation:** R codes that estimate the causal effect via TWFE and Staggered Difference in Difference.
- **Final Project Grozovskiy & Grados:** The final project itself.
- **project-presentation:** Summary of the work.
- **PAP Grados & Grozovskiy:** Pre-analysis plan (preregistration).
